	CHARACTER ENCODING CONVERSIONS

You can convert text between any two charsets, for example
`konwert cp437-iso2'.

Characters unavailable in the target charset will be substituted with
approximations with available ones. The approximations need not be
single characters.

The following character sets are currently supported:

ascii - 7bit ASCII

utf8 = unicode - Unicode UTF-8

iso1  = isolatin1               - ISO-8859-1 aka ISO Latin 1 (Western European)

      xmetodo - Esperanto: cx gx hx jx sx ux (vx w)

htmldec - SGML/HTML character references (decimal): &#198; &#283; &#8594;
htmlhex - SGML/HTML character references (hexadecimal): &#xC6; &#x11B; &#x2192;
htmlent - SGML/HTML character entities (names): &AElig; &ecaron; &rarr;
   html - All three above (only as input format)

tex - TeX with some LaTeX or AMS-TeX extensions. There is no distinction
between normal and math mode - you will probably have to insert some $'s
manually.

mnemonic  - RFC 1345 mnemonics preceded by &
mnemonic1 - RFC 1345 mnemonics preceded by `

any/LANGUAGE (e.g. any/pl-iso2) - This special input format will detect
the encoding automatically, basing on the frequencies of characters
found in text. Every language is associated with a set of possible
encodings used for it and average frequencies of its letters (excluding
ASCII letters). The best fitting encoding is used for conversion.
Currently supported languages are cs (Czech), de (German), el (Greek),
eo (Esperanto), es (Spanish), fr (French), he (Hebrew), it (Italian),
pl (Polish), pt (Portuguese), ru (Russian), and sv (Swedish).

varpl - Mixed Polish ISO-8859-2, CP-1250, and UTF-8. If you are reading
Polish newsgroups I suggest putting it as a filter in your newsreader
(for speed improvement it's better to call it directly, rather than
through konwert).

vareo - Mixed various Esperanto encodings.


	OPTIONS CONTROLLING THE ABOVE CONVERSIONS

/1 (e.g. `konwert iso2-ascii/1') - Each unavailable character will be
replaced only with a single approximate char, not string. This is useful
with the filterm program or with preformatted text. This option is
automatically turned on when a filter is used as output for filterm.

/html - Text is assumed to be HTML. The characters " & < > resulting
from other characters' approximations will be properly escaped as &quot;
&amp; &lt; &gt;. The
<META http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=...">
header will be fixed if present.

/htmldec - Convert META as above. Unavailable characters will be
encoded in &#Unicode;.

/htmlhex - Convert META as above. Unavailable characters will be
encoded in hexadecimal &#xUnicode;.

/tex - Unavailable characters will be described in TeX. Characters # $ %
& \ ^ _ { | } ~ resulting from some characters' approximations will be
properly escaped into \# \$ \% \& $\backslash$ \^{} \_ \{ $|$ \} \~{}.

/asciichar - Recognizes some ASCII representations of characters, e.g.
(c) ... 1/2 >=.

/rosyjski - Russian text will be replaced with its Polish phonetic
transcription.

Some output filters can use the language information for choosing better
approximations of unavailable letters, for example /de (German):
ä -> ae instead of a.


	OTHER FILTERS

any/LANGUAGE-test - Detects the encoding, but instead of text conversion
only shows the encoding's name. The additional option /all shows all
possible encodings, sorted from better to worse ones.

cr, lf, crlf - Force specific end-of-line marker convention.
cr = Macintosh, lf = Unix and Amiga, crlf = Windows and DOS.
The input convention is detected automatically.

expand - Expands tabs into spaces (uses the textutils program expand).

unexpand - Compresses spaces into tabs (uses the textutils program
unexpand).

rmspacesateol - Removes spaces and tabs at end of line.

qp-8bit, 8bit-qp - MIME Quoted Printable encoding: =A3=F3d=BC.

rtf-8bit, 8bit-rtf - Rich Text Format: \'a3\'f3d\'9f.

txt-htmlchar - Escapes " & < > into SGML/HTML entities &quot; &amp; &lt;
&gt;. Useful for including a text file inside HTML <PRE> </PRE> tags.

htmlchar-txt - Reverse.

rot13 - Guvf vf n qrzbafgengvba bs ebg13.

toupper, tolower - Self-explanatory. Currently ASCII only.

prn7pl - Converts polish chars to control sequences for EPSON-compatible
printer. Using only 7-bit chars, backspacing printer's head and vertical
positioning chars ,.'` it creates pseudo-polish gryphs. You can specify
options: /nlq (default) which optimalizes output for better quality
printers and /draft - useful for ex. for 9-nails printer.


	ADDITIONAL FILTERS FOR FILTERM

tyldy (input) - Polish ~a~c~e~l~n~o~s~x~z

lewyap (input) - Polish `a`c`e`l`n`o`s`x`z

boldpl (output) - ASCII with Polish letters shown as bold.

pinectrlchars (output) - Replaces the characters 128..159 shown by the
Pine (or another program) as ^À..^ß back to the real 128..159.

512bold (output) - Changes the mapping of colors in 512-character mode,
which restricts the number of colors to eight. The palette is
dynamically changed to contain the eight most recently used colors.
When more colors are used at once, some of them display incorrectly.

512bold1 (output) - Changes the mapping of colors in 512-character mode.
Instead of ignoring the intensity, the following colors are available:
black, red, green, white, blue, light magenta, light cyan, light gray;
others are substitutied with approximations. This gives better effect,
allowing to show the intensity, with the side-effect of belying the hue
of some colors.

kbdmacros (input) - Keyboard macros. A sequence of keys can be recorded
with `Esc Ctrl-A SEQUENCE Esc Ctrl-E SHORTCUT' - after which, if you
press the SHORTCUT, the SEQUENCE will be generated instead. Later such
assignment can be deleted with `Esc Ctrl-A Esc Ctrl-E SHORTCUT Esc
Ctrl-E'. Instead of Esc Ctrl- you often may press Ctrl-Alt-. The defined
shortcuts, together with the above redefinable key combinations used to
define them, are stored in the ~/.kbdmacros file. Note: when you
redefine a sequence, all its prefixes will not be passed through
immediately, but wait until it can be unambiguously told which sequence
was actually input. This includes escape sequences representing some
extended keys.
